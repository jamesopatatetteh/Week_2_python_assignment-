# Python List Operations

This project demonstrates basic list operations in Python such as appending, inserting, extending, deleting, sorting, and finding the index of an element.

## Features
The program performs the following steps:

1. Creates an empty list called `my_list`.
2. Appends the elements `10, 20, 30, 40` to the list.
3. Inserts the value `15` at the second position in the list.
4. Extends `my_list` with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Removes the last element from `my_list`.
6. Sorts the list in ascending order.
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30`.
